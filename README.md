## How to start up the project

The project is separated in two portions - backend for the REST API that we'll be using to work with the database and the frontend


#### 1. Database

In order to host the database locally, we'll use XAMPP

- Download [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) in order to run host the database

- Run Apache and MYSQL (make sure you import the database from backend/database after you run them)

#### 2. Backend

- Navigate to the backend directory
- npm install
- npm run start

#### 3. Frontend

- Navigate to the allrise directory
- npm install
- npm run serve
